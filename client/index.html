        <h2> You are about to undergo an official <strong>Citizen Evaluation</strong>.</h2></h2>

        <h3><strong>⚠ You are granted ONE submission only.</strong></h3>
        
        <h4>"Proceed with intention. Every response you provide is assessed by the NEXIS System, and each choice contributes to the determination of your designated living zone. Once submitted, your evaluation becomes final."</h4>

        <p><span>Zone 1</span> Prime Compliance — A polished utopia of advanced technology and immaculate design. Clean air, silent transit, luminous architecture, and fully automated homes create a flawless, luxurious environment.</p>
        
        <p><span>Zone 2</span> Standard Citizenry — Bright, stable, and comfortable. Well-kept apartments, reliable public services, walkable streets, and warm sunlight define a calm, predictable daily life.</p>
        
        <p><span>Zone 3</span> Conditional Classification — Dense, industrial, and heavily monitored. Factories, dormitory blocks, constant noise, and visible surveillance dominate an environment focused on labor and control over comfort.</p>
        
        <p><span>Zone 4</span> Restricted Designation — Decayed, unstable, and neglected. Cracked structures, failing utilities, debris-filled streets, and constant signs of unrest shape a harsh, unsafe living environment.</p>
